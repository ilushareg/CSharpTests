4 Implement data access
====Objective 4.1: Perform I/O operations

==Working with files
Never try to manually add strings together to form a path. Always use the Path class
==The file system is not just for you
Normally, when dealing with a situation in which multiple users access shared resources, we start using a locking mechanism to synchronize resource usage.
However, the file system does not have these locking mechanisms. It is a multithreaded system, but without any of the safety regulations that you want to see.
When working with the file system, you need to remind yourself that exceptions can and will occur.

Async/await
File class does not support real asynchronous I/O
For real async I/O, you need to use the FileStream object and pass a true value for the useAsync parameter.
